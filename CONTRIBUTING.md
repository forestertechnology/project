## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

   npm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables
5. Run the development server:

## Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- Create feature branches from `main`
- Use descriptive branch names:
  - `feature/add-new-feature`
  - `bugfix/resolve-authentication-issue`
  - `docs/update-readme`

### Commit Guidelines

  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <description>
  
  Examples:
  feat(database): add new subscription tier
  fix(auth): resolve login error
  docs(readme): update development instructions
  ```

## Database Management

### Type Synchronization
Always ensure database types are synchronized before committing:

```bash
# Interactively sync and validate types
npm run db:sync

# Validate types manually
npm run validate:db-types
```

### Creating Migrations
Use the interactive database management tool:
```bash
npm run db:manage
```

#### Migration Best Practices
- Create descriptive migration names
- Include comments explaining the migration's purpose
- Test migrations in a development environment first
- Avoid breaking changes when possible

## Code Quality

### Linting and Formatting

  ```bash
  npm run lint
